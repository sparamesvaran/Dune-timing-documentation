The FMC has SFP, Ethernet, and U.FL connectors, and can act as either as a timing master or endpoint, depending on the firmware uploaded onto the carrier board FPGA. The following instructions will allow you to set up and control the timing FMC. Pre-requisites Hardware: Timing FMC hosted on an Enclustra Mars PM3 base board with an Enclustra Mars AX3 FPGA module JTAG cable Linux machine (for control and firmware uploads) running CentOS xxx Software: The ProtoDUNE timing butler (pdtbutler), available fromh ttps://gitlab.cern.ch/protoDUNE-SP-DAQ/timing-board-software. The pdt-butler has the following software dependencies: boost libraries (v1.53), python2.7, and the uhal package (installation instruction can be found fromhttps://ipbus.web.cern.ch/ipbus/doc/user/html/software/installation.html).
