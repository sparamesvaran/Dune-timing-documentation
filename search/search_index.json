The FMC has SFP, Ethernet, and U.FL connectors, and can act as either as a timing master or endpoint, depending on the firmware uploaded onto the carrier board FPGA. The following instructions will allow you to set up and control the timing FMC. Pre-requisites Hardware: Timing FMC hosted on an Enclustra Mars PM3 base board with an Enclustra Mars AX3 FPGA module JTAG cable Linux machine (for control and firmware uploads) running CentOS xxx Software: The ProtoDUNE timing butler (pdtbutler) is a python-based command line tool which provides the functionality to control the timing FMC. The pdt-butler has the following software dependencies: boost libraries (v1.53), python 2.7, and the uhal package (installation instructions can be found from https://ipbus.web.cern.ch/ipbus/doc/user/html/software/installation.html). Installation instructions for the ProtoDUNE timing software To set up the pdtbutler, please execute the following steps on the control machine.
